- **Extensible Architecture**: Supports addition of new attack vectors and defense mechanisms
- **Empirical Validation**: Includes real-world case studies on commercial robotic platforms

### Key Features

- 🛡️ **Comprehensive Coverage**: 50+ attack vectors across Physical, Sensor & Perception, Data Processing, Middleware, Decision-Making, Application, and Social Interface layers
- 📊 **Quantitative Metrics**: Weighted risk scores with statistical validation
- 🎯 **Practical Applicability**: Tested on 10+ commercial robotic platforms
- 🔧 **Automated Assessment**: Scriptable evaluation pipeline for CI/CD integration

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Option 1: Using pip (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anonymous4sc1ence/submission.git
cd submission

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Option 2: Using conda
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anonymous4sc1ence/submission.git
cd submission

# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate risk-map

```
Verify Installation
```
python scripts/score_RISK_MAP.py --help

```
⚡ Quick Start
Basic Assessment

Run RISK-MAP assessment on all robots in the dataset:
```
python scripts/score_RISK_MAP.py

```
This will:

Process all *_implementation_status.csv files in data/

Generate individual radar charts in figures/[robot_name]/

Create per-layer scores in data/per_layer_scores.csv

Display summary results in the terminal

Generate Comparative Analysis

Create combined visualization comparing multiple robots:
```
python scripts/combined_radar.py

```
Expected Output
```
[✓]    Robot1: RISK_MAP  39.9%  → figures/Robot1
[✓]    Robot2: RISK_MAP  48.9%  → figures/Robot2  
[✓]    Robot3: RISK_MAP  79.5%  → figures/Robot3
[✓] Wrote per-layer scores → data/per_layer_scores.csv
[✓] Combined radar → figures/combined_radar.pdf

```
📖 Detailed Usage
Assessing a New Robot

1. Create Implementation Status File:
```
cp data/template_implementation_status.csv data/my_robot_implementation_status.csv

```
2. Edit Defense Implementation Status:
3. Update the CSV with your robot's defense implementations (0.0 = not implemented, 1.0 = fully implemented)

Run Assessment:
```
python scripts/score_RISK_MAP.py --impl data/my_robot_implementation_status.csv

```
Custom Attack-Defense Matrix

To use your own attack-defense relationships:
```
python scripts/score_RISK_MAP.py --matrix path/to/custom_matrix.csv --weights path/to/custom_weights.csv

```
Advanced Analysis

For detailed layer-by-layer analysis:
```
from scripts.score_RISK_MAP import compute_scores
import pandas as pd

# Load data
A = pd.read_csv("data/attacks_vs_defenses_normalised.csv", index_col='Attack Vector')
W = pd.read_csv("data/attack_weights.csv", index_col='Attack Vector')['Weight']
I = pd.read_csv("data/robot_implementation_status.csv", index_col='Defence')['Implementation']

# Compute scores
overall, layer_scores, effectiveness_matrix = compute_scores(A, W, I)

print(f"Overall Security Score: {overall:.2f}")
for layer, score in layer_scores.items():
    print(f"{layer}: {score:.3f}")

```
# Reproducing Paper Results
Main Experimental Results (Section 5)
```


```
Expected runtime: ~5 minutes on standard desktop hardware.
