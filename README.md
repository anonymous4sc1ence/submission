# Humanoid Security SoK — Artifact Repository (Anonymous)

> **Anonymous Artifact for USENIX Security (SoK)**  
> This repository accompanies the paper:  
> *“SoK: Cybersecurity Assessment of the Humanoid Ecosystem”*  

It contains two main components:  
1. **RISK-MAP** — the core method, data, and code to reproduce all figures, tables, and scores in the paper.  
2. **Related Works** — PRISMA diagram, survey notes, bibliographic material, and literature mappings supporting the SoK.

## 1. RISK-MAP (Artifact)

The `1. RISK_MAP/` folder contains:

- **Core data**: attack–defense matrices, severity weights, and per-robot implementation CSVs.  
- **Scripts**: to compute scores, generate radar/heatmaps, and run Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses.  
- **Notebook**: `RISK_MAP_Assessment.ipynb` — main entrypoint for reproduction.  
- **Figures**: generated plots corresponding to paper results (Figures 4a/4b, Table 3, sensitivity tables).  

📖 See the detailed [RISK-MAP README](./1.%20RISK_MAP/readme.md) for step-by-step instructions to reproduce results.

## 2. Related Works

The `2. Related_works/` folder contains:

- Curated literature survey spreadsheets and notes.  
- Paper classification tables by attack/defense and layer.  
- Reference material used in constructing the SoK taxonomy.  

This folder supports transparency of the **systematization process** (PRISMA-style review + coverage tables) but is not required to reproduce numerical RISK-MAP outputs.

## How to Reproduce the Results

1. Navigate to the RISK-MAP folder:
   ```bash
   cd "submission/1. RISK_MAP"
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in its README to:
   - Run the notebook for full reproduction, or
   - Use scripts/ for command-line reproduction.
3. Generated figures and CSVs will appear under figures/ and data/sensitivity/.

### Artifact Scope
   RISK-MAP provides the quantitative evaluation and visualisations in the paper.
   Related Works provides the literature synthesis basis of the SoK.
   Together, these two components ensure both computational reproducibility and literature traceability.

### License & Anonymity
   Code and data are released solely for artifact evaluation.
   Please do not attempt to deanonymize authors during review.
