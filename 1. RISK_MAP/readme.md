## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.8+**
- Git
- JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook

#### Option 1 — `venv` + pip (recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anonymous4sc1ence/submission.git
cd submission

python -m venv venv
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows PowerShell:
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -r requirements.txt


```
#### Option 2: Using conda
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anonymous4sc1ence/submission.git
cd submission

# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate risk-map

```
#### Verify Installation
```
python scripts/score_RISK_MAP.py --help

```
### Quick Start
#### Assessment

Run RISK-MAP assessment on all robots in the dataset:
```
python scripts/score_RISK_MAP.py

```
#### This will:

  - Process all *_implementation_status.csv files in data/
  - Generate individual radar charts in figures/[robot_name]/
  - Create per-layer scores in data/per_layer_scores.csv
  - Display summary results in the terminal
  - Create combined visualization comparing multiple robots:
#### Expected Output
```
[✓]    Robot1: RISK_MAP  39.9%  → figures/Robot1
[✓]    Robot2: RISK_MAP  48.9%  → figures/Robot2  
[✓]    Robot3: RISK_MAP  79.5%  → figures/Robot3
[✓] Wrote per-layer scores → data/per_layer_scores.csv
[✓] Combined radar → figures/combined_radar.pdf

```

# Reproducing Paper Results
Main Experimental Results (Section 5)


> All reproduction steps below assume your shell is located at: `submission/1. RISK_MAP/`.



## What this artifact reproduces (from the paper)

- **Layer coverage radar plots** and **defense coverage heatmaps** for three humanoids (Digit, G1 EDU, Pepper), and  
- **Overall risk-weighted scores** with layer-wise diagnostics and **Top-10 residual risks for the 3 robots** .

These correspond to the quantitative RISK-MAP method and results reported in the paper (Sections 5–5.2; Figures 4a/4b; Table 3).



## Quick Start (Notebook-first, recommended)

1) **Create an environment** (pick one):
- **venv**
```
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  # Windows:
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  # Linux/macOS:
  source .venv/bin/activate

```
  # Minimal packages commonly used in the artifact
```
  pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib

```
Open the RISK-MAP notebook in this folder (the notebook provided in 1. RISK_MAP/) and Run All.
The notebook will:

 - Load the core matrices from data/attacks_vs_defenses_normalised.csv and data/attack_weights.csv.
 - Load robot implementation CSVs in data/ (e.g., *_implementation_status.csv).
 - Compute:
    -- Overall RISK-MAP score per robot
    -- 7-layer coverage (radar)
    -- Top-10 residual risks (heatmap)
    -- Write figures into figures/ (per-robot subfolders) and any combined plots (e.g., figures/RISK_MAP_combined_radar.pdf, figures/combined_heatmap_safe_r.png).

Note (Windows paths): If you run from OneDrive or paths containing spaces, the notebook/plots still work as long as you keep relative paths (as they are in the repo).
```
```
Expected runtime: ~5 minutes on standard desktop hardware.
